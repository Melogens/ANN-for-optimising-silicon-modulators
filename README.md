# ANN-for-optimising-silicon-modulators
Hi everyone!
My name is Melody Phyu Sin, and this is my internship project on building an artificial neural network for the optimisation of a silicon modulator

Independent variables: voltage (V), junction offset (nm), P concentration and N concentration (10^17 cm^3).
Dependent varaibels: Optical loss and Phase response.

Example dataset with voltage (0 to 6), offset (-250 to 250), concentrations (1 to 12). Not all included here.
