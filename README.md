# ANN-for-optimising-silicon-modulators
Hi everyone!
My name is Melody, and this is my internship project on building an artificial neural network for the optimisation of a silicon modulator
Independent variables: voltage (V), junction offset (nm), P concentration and N concentration (10^17 cm^3)
Dependent varaibels: Optical loss and Phase response

Trained data is over 1053 datasets
